"""
The ``zen.io`` package provides functions for reading and writing networks to and from storage (whether files, databases, or otherwise).
The only IO functionality that is not explicitly provided here is the pickling capability that is built directly into the
:py:class:`zen.Graph` and :py:class:`DiGraph` base classes.

While formats and storage systems differ, we have established standards to keep the interfaces for reading and writing as uniform as
possible across the different storage systems.  Every storage system has its own module (e.g., :py:mod:`zen.edgelist`, :py:mod:`zen.gml`, and :py:mod:`zen.memlist`).  Furthermore, each module exposes two standard functions for reading and writing:

	* ``read(source,<keyword arguments>)``
	* ``write(graph,destination,<keyword arguments>)``
	
the ``source`` and ``destination`` parameters are storage system specific (e.g., for files, these will be file names).  ``graph`` is any
valid Zen graph object.  ``keyword arguments`` are used to customize the read or write operation.  While some will be storage system
specific, several are common enough to warrent being standardized across storage systems.

*Read keyword arguments*:

	* ``node_obj_fxn [= str]``: this is a function that accepts a string (the node object as a string) and returns the node object 
	  that should be used in the graph.  If not specified, the default functionality is to use string node objects.
	  If ``node_obj_fxn`` is ``None``, then no node objects are stored for nodes loaded.
		
	* ``directed [= False]`` (boolean): this indicates whether the topology information read should be interpreted as directed or
	  undirected graph data.  The graph returned will be accordingly directed or undirected.  By default, methods assume
	  data to be undirected.  Note that this parameter is not supported (or needed) by some storage systems in which 
	  the directionality of the data is encoded in the source.
	
	* ``ignore_duplicate_edges [= False]`` (boolean): occasionally data sources will contain duplicate edges 
	  (this is certainly true when directed data is being read as undirected data).  Setting this argument to 
	  ``True`` will suppress the generation of errors related to the presence of duplicate edges in the data.
		
	* ``merge_graph [= None]`` (:py:class:`zen.Graph` or :py:class:`zen.DiGraph`): rather than creating a new network object, 
	  the data read can be merged with an existing one.  If this argument is set to a valid Zen network object, then the read 
	  method will attempt to load the data into the existing network.  The directionality of the existing graph will be used 
	  to decide on the interpretation of the directionality of the source data read.  If the source data has an explicit 
	  directionality that disagrees with the network object provided, an error will be raised.
		
	* ``weight_fxn [= None]``: in formats for which data may be loaded for edges, but weights are not explicitly defined,
	  this function can be used to assign weight values to edges based on their data.  The function accepts the edge data
	  argument and returns the numerical weight.

*Write keyword arguments*:

	* ``use_node_indices [= False]`` (boolean): this argument indicates that the node indices should be used as the unique identifier for each
	  node in the destination rather than the node objects (which is the default).  This argument is only supported by methods
	  for which node indices are not required.
