"""
The ``zen.data`` package bundles a number of public, frequently-used network datasets into the Zen library.  The intent of including these is to both make it easier for new users to play with real data and to enable established users to rapidly test ideas (algorithms, analysis, etc...) on known datasets.

While the ``zen.data`` package contains the data files for the various datasets, convenience functions are provided for loading each of the different datasets that are included.  Presently, the following datasets are included:

	* Knuth's *Les Miserable* dataset (``lesmis.gml``)
	* Padgett's *Florentine marriage* network (``florentine.scn``)
	* Zachary's Karate club network (``karate.scn``)
