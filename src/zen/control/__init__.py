"""
The ``zen.control`` package provides functions and classes for analyzing the control structure of a network.  In particular, much of the
functionality currently implemented focuses on the perspective and machinery provided by structural controllability.

*This package is currently under active development and will be regularly updated, though the API specified will remain stable.*

Reachability
------------

Under structural controllability, a set of directly controlled nodes can control a limited set of other nodes.  The 
number of such nodes that can be controlled is called the *reachability* or *generic rank* of the network under those
controls.

.. autofunction:: num_min_controls(G)

Control Profiles
----------------

Control profiles were devised as a measure for quantifying the structures responsible for dictating how many
controls a network requires and where these controls much attach to the network.

.. seealso::

.. autofunction:: profile(G,...)

Visualizing control profile plots can be particularly helpful when comparing the control profiles of different
networks.  Two functions are provided for this purpose.

.. autofunction:: profile_plot(G,...)

.. autofunction:: profile_heatmap(G,...)
