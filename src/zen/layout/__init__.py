"""
The ``zen.layout`` module provides functions for assigning positions to nodes and paths to edges according to a
selected algorithm.  Different algorithms attempt to maximize the aesthetic quality (e.g., readability) of the resulting
layout in different ways.

In order to standardize the handling of the graph visualization pipeline, all graph layout functions produce a new or 
modify an existing :py:class:`zen.View` object. Graph layout functions all return the view object produced or modified.

**Standard arguments**:

*Positional arguments.* In addition to algorithm-specific parameters, each layout function accepts one positional argument: a graph or view object.
If a graph is specified, then a new view is created.  If a view is specified, then the graph of the view (:py:meth:`zen.View.graph`)
is used and the current layout of the view is replaced by the newly generated layout.

*Keyword arguments.* All layout functions also accept the following keyword arguments:

	* ``bbox [=(0,0,100,100)]`` (:py:class:`tuple`): a tuple (left,bottom,top,right) indicating the spatial bounds that constrian the layout.
	  If set to ``None``, then positions and paths are unconstrained.  By default, the bounding box is (0,0,100,100).
