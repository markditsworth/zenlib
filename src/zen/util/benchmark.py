"""
A core objective of Zen is to provide among the fastest network-based functionality available.  In order to do this, the Zen
library includes a benchmarking class.  Much like a unit test, a benchmark subclass defines a set of methods that run code
whose performance will be quantified.  Benchmarking is implicitly comparative - so the benchmark class is designed to make
comparison between the performance of the different benchmark methods easy.  Textual and graphical output can be produced
showing how the performance of the different benchmark functions performed.

The remainder of this document explains how the ``zen.util.benchmark.Benchmark`` class should be subclassed and used.

Initialization
--------------

A subclass should call the :py:meth:`Benchmark.__init__` function.

.. automethod:: Benchmark.__init__(name,number=3)

Setup and teardown
------------------

Prior to running the individual benchmarks, the ``Benchmark.setup()`` method is called.  Any work done in this
method is not included in the timed computations.

After the benchmarks have been run, the ``Benchmark.teardown()`` method is called.  This function can do any cleanup
or releasing of resources that were allocated for the benchmarking functions.

Benchmark methods
-----------------

A benchmark method has the form ``bm_<name>()``, where ``bm_`` is flags it as a benchmark method and ``<name>`` is the name
of the specific item being benchmarked by this method.  The method accepts no arguments and returns no values.  Literally
anything can be done inside the method since the benchmark class is only interested in how long it takes for the function
to return.

Typically more than one benchmark method will be defined per benchmark class in order to permit the comparison of 
several different techniques, libraries, implementations, or algorithms.

Command-line interface
----------------------

The ``zen.util.benchmark`` module provides a ``main()`` function that, when executed, finds 
all ``Benchmark`` subclasses within the current namespace, and runs the the benchmarks according
the the command-line arguments provided (note that the function accepts no arguments - all configuration
is assumed to come through ``sys.argv``).

Detailed instruction for the command-line interface can be found by providing the ``-h`` flag.  Of note,
the interface supports generating two kinds of output:

	* *Textual.* By default and in all cases, the tool will generate text output showing the results of
	  each benchmark run.
	
	* *Graphical.* When the ``plots`` or ``xplots`` commands are given, a histogram is generated for each
	  benchmark showing the relative performance of each benchmark method in a given benchmark.  The histogram
	  is saved in PNG format to the current working directory.
	
		* ``plots`` generates histograms in which the y-axis is the time taken by each benchmark method.
		
		* ``xplots`` generates histograms in which the y-axis is the order of improvement of each benchmark method
		  relative to the slowest benchmark.
