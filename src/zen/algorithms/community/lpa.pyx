	"""
	Detect communities in a graph using the Label-Propagation Algorithm (LPA)
	described in [RAG2007]_. It assigns a unique label to each node, then 
	propagates the labels by assigning to each node the label shared by the
	majority of its neighbors (ties are broken randomly). This continues until
	each node's label agrees with its neighbors'. Communities are the groups of
	nodes with the same label.

	**Keyword Args**:

		* ``use_weights [=False]`` (boolean): if ``True``, then the weights of
			the graph are taken into consideration when detecting communities.
		
		* ``max_iterations [=None]`` (int): if greater than or equal to zero, 
			the algorithm will run at most this many iterations. Negative values
			and ``None`` indicate that the algorithm will run until normal 
			completion.
			
	**Returns**:
		A :py:class:`CommunitySet` containing the communities detected in the 
		graph.
