	It assigns a table to each node, containing the probabilities 
	that this node has a certain label. At each step, this table is propagated 
	to the node's neighbors. Then, it is inflated (raised to a certain power, 
	which increases the differences between high and low probabilities). Entries
	below a given threshold are removed from the table.	Finally, a node's table 
	is only updated if it disagrees enough with its neighbors. The algorithm 
	stops either when there have been no changes or	when the same number of 
	changes happened too many times.

	**Args**

		* ``inflation [=4.0]`` (float): the power to which the probabilities
			are to be raised after every propagation step. Higher values
			cause a larger difference in small and large probabilities.

		* ``cutoff_thresh [=0.1]`` (float): the cut-off below which inflated
			probabilities are removed from the table. Higher values limit
			propagation of low-probability labels.

		* ``cond_update [=0.7]`` (float): the percentage of agreement required
			between a node and its neighbors to not update this node anymore.

	**Keyword Args**

		* ``max_num_changes [=5]`` (int): the number of times a particular
			number of updates is allowed before stopping the algorithm. For
			example, with ``max_num_changes = 5``, the algorithm will stop
			if it detects that some number of updates occured 5 times.

		* ``max_iterations [=None]`` (int): if greater than or equal to zero, 
			the algorithm will run at most this many iterations. Negative values
			and ``None`` indicate that the algorithm will run until normal 
			completion.

	**Returns**
		A :py:module:CommunitySet containing the communities detected in the 
		graph. This is done by taking the label with maximal probability and 
		assigning it to the node (in case of a tie, the first maximal label in 
		the table is used). Then, the communities are formed by groups of nodes 
		with the same label.
