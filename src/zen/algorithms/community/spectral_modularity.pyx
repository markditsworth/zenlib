	"""
	Detect communities in a graph using the algorithm described in [NEW2006]_.
	It repeatedly divides the graph in two, using the leading eigenvector of
	the graph's modularity matrix to make the division. A sub-graph is
	considered indivisible if dividing it would result in negative modularity.
	This algorithm only supports undirected, unweighted graphs. In addition,
	the graph must be compact.

	** Keyword Args **

		* ``fine_tune [=False]`` (boolean): Whether to fine-tune the results at
		each step. If ``True``, the algorithm will manually move nodes from
		one community to the other after dividing a sub-graph in two, in order
		to maximize the modularity of the sub-graph. Hence, the detected
		communities should be of higher quality, but this comes at the expense
		of additional processing time.

	** Returns **
	# TODO

	** Raises **
		``ZenException``: If the graph is directed, weighted or not compact.
